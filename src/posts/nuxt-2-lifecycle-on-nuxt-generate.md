when running `nuxt generate`, at build time, call order:

- plugins on plugin folder
- page route guard `beforeRouteEnter`
- global router middleware
- `middleware` on page options
- page `asyncData`
- page legacy deprecated `fetch`
- page `beforeCreate`
- page data function
- page `created`
- page `fetch` hook

then when the page is called on the client when using `nuxt start`, call order:

- plugins on plugin folder
- page `beforeRouteEnter`
- global router middleware
- page `beforeCreate`
- page `data`
- page `created`
- page `beforeMount`
- page `mounted`

when there is a client-side navigation (using `nuxt-link`), call order:

- from: `beforeRouteLeave`
- global `router.middleware`
- to: `middleware`
- to: `beforeRouteEnter`
- from: `beforeDestroy`
- from: `destroyed`
- to: `beforeCreate`
- to: `data`
- to: `created`
- to: `beforeMount`
- to: `mounted`
