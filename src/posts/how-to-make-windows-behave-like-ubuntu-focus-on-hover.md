Well apperently there is this option:

  - https://joelpurra.com/projects/X-Mouse_Controls/

Or you go there and edit the registers yourself. I originally did this by myself following a tutorial I didn't find right now, and I was planning on replicating the word here to make it easier for me to re-find this when I format my system again (or by a new one). But, as I found this "X-Mouse Controls", I'm quite satisfied with the results from this utility, and I suggest using it, if in the future I end up finding this original post, I will add more information on doing this manually, but for now, this works for me.
