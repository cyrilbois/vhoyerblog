Hop onto the [real favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), and get results better than anything you could do on your first try. Whenever I have to make those, I always use this tool and use it as a base for later editing anything that didn't go as pristine as it could.

This is a quick one, there is nothing much I can really add here, as the real favicon generator mostly do all the work and we are left just to choose options there, if I may offer just one recommendation it would be: explore all the options the site offers, as it can deliver better results.
