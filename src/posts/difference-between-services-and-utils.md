If you are going to use this post to win a discussion, think again, this is just my take on this, you could use it to base a defense for your point being it a point in favor or against this view of mine, that being said, this post is being made to serve as a guide to myself whenever I feel the need to recall my own conclusions.

Being mostly from a front-end written in javascript background, I used to think that services were classes and utils were functions, and while this can serve as a not-terrible rule of thumb, it can lead to some weird "weird" unnatural interfaces.

// todo: talk a bit about services

// todo: talk a bit about utils

Basically, the difference comes down solely to scope, be it a class or a function, if it has a clear scope it's a service, if it's for general use it's a utils.
